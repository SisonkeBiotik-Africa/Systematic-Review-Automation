# Systematic-Review-Automation
A set of Python tools for the automation of the main tasks for the creation and refinement of bibliometric studies and systematic reviews

## Introduction
Within the framework of Sisonkebiotik Community, it will be interesting to conduct research works to identify the state-of-the-art of biomedical artificial intelligence in Africa and abroad. This will enable the recognition of research and development capacities in Africa that can contribute to the enhancement of Biomedical Machine Learning in Africa and consequently the development of continent-level research collaborations about this interesting topic. Such scholarly publications include bibliometric studies that quantitatively and qualitatively assess the research productivity of individuals, groups and countries based on the large-scale analysis of bibliographic metadata using statistics and association analysis. They also involve systematic reviews and meta-analyses that retrieve the findings and settings of research papers about a given research topic using natural language processing techniques and human curation and represent them in structured summary tables and visualizations.
