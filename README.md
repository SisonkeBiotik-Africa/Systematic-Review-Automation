# Systematic-Review-Automation
A set of Python tools for the automation of the main tasks for the creation and refinement of bibliometric studies and systematic reviews

## Introduction
Within the framework of Sisonkebiotik Community, it will be interesting to conduct research works to identify the state-of-the-art of biomedical artificial intelligence in Africa and abroad. This will enable the recognition of research and development capacities in Africa that can contribute to the enhancement of Biomedical Machine Learning in Africa and consequently the development of continent-level research collaborations about this interesting topic. Such scholarly publications include bibliometric studies that quantitatively and qualitatively assess the research productivity of individuals, groups and countries based on the large-scale analysis of bibliographic metadata using statistics and association analysis. They also involve systematic reviews and meta-analyses that retrieve the findings and settings of research papers about a given research topic using natural language processing techniques and human curation and represent them in structured summary tables and visualizations. The development of such an output requires a lot of work. Effectively, authors need to formulate the most efficient query that allows them to get all the scholarly publications on the assessed topic. Then, the authors have to eliminate the odd records that are not related to the area from the initially returned search results. After that, the authors need to define the characteristics that should be retrieved from scholarly publications to allow the creation of a systematic review or a bibliometric study. In this project, we will try to automate these three tasks for a quicker development of literature reviews and scientometric analyses.
